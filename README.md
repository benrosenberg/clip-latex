# clip-latex
a simple gui text input that gives you a png with the latex output of your text

written in python.

## dependencies
* [python](https://www.python.org)
* [latex](https://www.latex-project.org/get/) and pdflatex
* [imagemagick](https://imagemagick.org/index.php)
* [cat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cat_(Unix))
* [xclip](https://github.com/astrand/xclip)
* [zenipy](https://github.com/poulp/zenipy)

## how it works
self explanatory in code comments

## how to use
run `python generator.py` in terminal or somehow execute the generator.py file in some other way.

### recommended way to use
if you have an i3config file or some other file in which you can set system-wide keybinds, bind some keyboard shortcut to executing `python generator.py`. That way you'll be able to use it the way it's intended (without terminal).

### note
see my other repos cli-latex and sent-latex for other implementations of python and latex stuff and pngs
